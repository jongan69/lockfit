   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Solana Integration

### Deploy the lockfitstaking program

1. Set Solana CLI to Devnet:
   ```bash
   solana config set --url devnet
   ```

2. Build the program:
   ```bash
   cargo build-sbf
   ```

3. Request SOL airdrop:
   ```bash
   solana airdrop 1
   ```

4. Deploy the program:
   ```bash
   solana program deploy ./target/deploy/lockfitstaking.so
   ```

## Current Development Focus

- Implementing user authentication flow
- Designing and building the workout tracking interface
- Developing the Solana smart contract for token staking
- Creating the rewards distribution system
- Optimizing app performance and UI/UX

# DEV Notes
- App.json is where the env variables are set, React Native uses these to know which network to connect to, which RPC to use, etc.
- The env variables are set via expo, and can be accessed via `Constants.expoConfig.extra.{variable}`
