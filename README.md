# Lockfit: Your Expo Workout App with Solana Integration üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí™

Lockfit is a comprehensive workout app built with Expo, featuring Solana blockchain integration for token staking and rewards. Our project aims to revolutionize the fitness industry by leveraging blockchain technology to incentivize users and create a more engaging workout experience.

## Features

- Workout tracking and planning
- Solana-based token staking and rewards system
- User authentication and profile management
- Social features (workout sharing, challenges)
- Performance analytics and progress tracking

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React Native with Expo
- Backend: Node.js
- Blockchain: Solana (Devnet)
- Smart Contract: Rust

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Solana Integration

### Deploy the lockfitstaking program

1. Set Solana CLI to Devnet:
   ```bash
   solana config set --url devnet
   ```

2. Build the program:
   ```bash
   cargo build-sbf
   ```

3. Request SOL airdrop:
   ```bash
   solana airdrop 1
   ```

4. Deploy the program:
   ```bash
   solana program deploy ./target/deploy/lockfitstaking.so
   ```

## Current Development Focus and Roadmap

1. User Authentication (In Progress)
   - Implementing secure sign-in flow using Phantom wallet (app/signinComplete.tsx)
   - Integrating with backend for nonce generation and verification

2. Workout Tracking Interface (Next Sprint)
   - Designing intuitive UI for logging workouts
   - Implementing real-time data sync with Solana blockchain

3. Solana Smart Contract Development (Ongoing)
   - Finalizing staking logic in lockfitstaking program (solanaprogram/lockfitstaking/src/lib.rs)
   - Implementing reward calculation based on workout data and staked amount

4. Rewards Distribution System (Upcoming)
   - Developing a fair and motivating reward mechanism
   - Integrating with Solana program for automatic distribution

5. Performance Optimization (Continuous)
   - Refining React Native components for smooth user experience
   - Optimizing Solana transactions for cost-effectiveness

6. Social Features Integration (Future Sprint)
   - Implementing workout sharing functionality
   - Developing challenge system for user engagement

7. Analytics Dashboard (Planned)
   - Creating comprehensive performance tracking tools
   - Visualizing user progress and token earnings

## In-Depth Logic and Current Work

- User Authentication: We're utilizing Phantom wallet for secure authentication. The signinComplete.tsx file handles the sign-in process, including nonce request and signature verification.

- Solana Integration: The utils/solana directory contains helper functions for Solana transactions, including buildUrl.ts for constructing Phantom deep links.

- Smart Contract: Our Rust-based smart contract (lib.rs) defines the core logic for staking, unstaking, and reward distribution. We're currently fine-tuning the reward calculation algorithm.

- Rewards System: The rewards.tsx file in the app/(tabs) directory is being developed to display user rewards and handle claiming functionality.

## Hackathon Roadmap

Week 1:
- Complete user authentication flow
- Finalize smart contract logic for staking and rewards

Week 2:
- Develop core workout tracking features
- Integrate Solana transactions for staking and unstaking

Week 3:
- Implement rewards distribution system
- Create basic analytics dashboard

Week 4:
- Polish UI/UX
- Conduct thorough testing and bug fixes
- Prepare project presentation and documentation

## Project Impact and Business Plan

Lockfit aims to disrupt the $100 billion global fitness app market by introducing blockchain-based incentives. Our unique value proposition lies in the seamless integration of workout tracking with financial rewards, creating a powerful motivation system for users.

Business Model:
1. Freemium app with premium features unlocked by staking $LOCKFIT tokens
2. Transaction fees from reward distributions
3. Partnerships with fitness brands for sponsored challenges and rewards

Market Potential:
- Target market: 500 million global fitness app users
- Projected user base: 1 million users within the first year post-launch
- Estimated annual revenue: $10 million by Year 3

Open-Source Strategy:
We're committed to open-sourcing key components of our project to foster innovation and collaboration within the Solana ecosystem. This includes our smart contract code and core integration libraries.

# DEV Notes
- App.json is where the env variables are set, React Native uses these to know which network to connect to, which RPC to use, etc.
- The env variables are set via expo, and can be accessed via `Constants.expoConfig.extra.{variable}`
