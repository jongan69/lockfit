## Data Flow and State Management

### Overview

Lockfit uses Zustand for state management and SQLite for persistent storage. The combination of these technologies allows for efficient state management and data persistence across app sessions.

### State Management with Zustand

Zustand is used to manage the application's state, including user preferences, workout data, custom programs, and recent activities. The state is defined in the `UserStore` and includes functions to update and retrieve state.

#### Key State Variables

- `isImperial`: Boolean indicating whether the user prefers imperial units.
- `workoutData`: Array of workout data.
- `customPrograms`: Array of custom workout programs.
- `recentActivity`: Array of recent user activities.
- `exerciseProgress`: Array of exercise progress data.
- `selectedProgram`: The currently selected workout program.
- `lastCompletedWeights`: Record of the last completed weights for exercises.
- `workoutHistory`: Record of the user's workout history.

#### Key Functions

- `toggleUnits`: Toggles between imperial and metric units.
- `setWorkoutData`: Sets the workout data.
- `setCustomPrograms`: Sets the custom workout programs.
- `addRecentActivity`: Adds a recent activity.
- `clearRecentActivity`: Clears the recent activities.
- `setExerciseProgress`: Sets the exercise progress data.
- `updateExercisePR`: Updates the personal record for an exercise.
- `setSelectedProgram`: Sets the selected workout program.
- `saveWorkoutHistory`: Saves the workout history.
- `loadPreferences`: Loads user preferences from SQLite.

### Persistent Storage with SQLite

SQLite is used to persist user data across app sessions. The database is initialized and managed using the `expo-sqlite` library. Key user preferences and workout data are stored in the SQLite database.

#### Database Initialization

The database is initialized with the following tables:

- `preferences`: Stores user preferences.
- `workouts`: Stores workout data.
- `exercises`: Stores exercise data.
- `sets`: Stores set data for exercises.

#### Key Database Operations

- `savePreference`: Saves a user preference to the database.
- `getPreference`: Retrieves a user preference from the database.
- `saveWorkoutHistory`: Saves the workout history to the database.
- `loadPreferences`: Loads user preferences from the database.

### Data Flow

1. **Initialization**: When the app starts, the SQLite database is initialized, and user preferences are loaded using the `loadPreferences` function.
2. **State Management**: The Zustand store (`UserStore`) manages the state of the application. State updates are performed using the functions defined in the store.
3. **User Actions**: User actions, such as starting a workout or updating preferences, trigger state updates and database operations to ensure data persistence.
4. **Rendering**: The app's components, such as `Home` and `WorkoutList`, use the state from the `UserStore` to render the UI and handle user interactions.

### Example: Starting a Workout

1. The user selects a workout to start.
2. The `handleWorkoutStart` function in the `Home` component is called, which updates the state to set the active workout and hides the tab bar.
3. The workout timer starts, and the workout duration is tracked.
4. When the workout is completed, the `handleWorkoutComplete` function is called, which updates the state, saves the workout history to the database, and adds a recent activity.

## Areas of Improvement and Features Needed

### Areas of Improvement

1. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling throughout the app, especially for database operations and network requests.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the performance of the app, particularly in areas with heavy data processing or rendering.
3. **Code Quality**: Refactor and clean up the codebase to improve readability and maintainability.
4. **Testing**: Increase test coverage, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

### Features Needed

1. **User Authentication**: Complete the implementation of secure user authentication using Phantom wallet.
2. **Workout Tracking Interface**: Design and implement an intuitive UI for logging workouts, including real-time data sync with the Solana blockchain.
3. **Rewards Distribution System**: Develop a fair and motivating reward mechanism and integrate it with the Solana program for automatic distribution.
4. **Social Features**: Implement workout sharing functionality and develop a challenge system for user engagement.
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Create comprehensive performance tracking tools and visualize user progress and token earnings.
6. **Notifications**: Implement push notifications to remind users of their workouts and notify them of rewards.
7. **Multi-language Support**: Add support for multiple languages to make the app accessible to a broader audience.
8. **Dark Mode**: Ensure that all components and screens support dark mode for a better user experience in low-light conditions.
